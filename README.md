This Project is for Synthesis of Digital Audio using C programming language.
in this programming language i was able to use many c concepts like:
   1. File handeling in C
   2. Loops
   3. Conditional Statement
   4. Digital Audio Concepts : PWM, Bit depth (16-bit samples), Sampling rate (samples per second).
   5. Pointers
   6. Input/Output

The RAW file which C program generated can be processed and played in Audacity Software.
Audacity Software - it is basiccaly a software which is used to edit and record audio and it is also capable of importing files like RAW file which this software can process.
                    it requires some information to be put manually 
                    1. The sample rate (44100 Hz)
                    2. The bit depth (16-bit PCM)
                    3. The encoding 
                    4. The number of channels (mono)
